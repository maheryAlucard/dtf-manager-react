Usage Guidelines:
Use Primary Cyan for all main CTAs, active menu items, and progress indicators.
Use Magenta for secondary actions, highlights, and accents (ex: “Create New Invoice”).
Use Yellow sparingly for alerts, warnings, or stock-low indicators.
Use Lime Green for success states (payments complete, stock replenished).
Use Red only for errors (failed actions, overdue invoices, stock empty).
Backgrounds must remain clean/neutral (white or dark gray panels) to let accent colors pop.
Keep typography high contrast: dark text on light backgrounds, light text on dark.

Components Styling:

Buttons:
Primary → Cyan background, white text, rounded-lg, hover: darker cyan.
Secondary → Magenta outline or fill, hover: darker magenta.
Cards / Panels → White background, soft shadow, rounded-xl, with Magenta or Cyan headers.
Tables → Zebra stripes with subtle gray (#F9FAFB), Cyan highlights for active rows.
Charts → Use Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Lime consistently for datasets.

General Principle:
The theme must feel energetic, creative, and inspired by printing (CMYK) while keeping data easy to read. Neutral backgrounds are mandatory to avoid color overload.
